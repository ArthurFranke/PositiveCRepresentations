# PositiveCRepresentations

The given Java-Project lets you generate c-representations with both impact-factors. 
It was common to use c-representations, where all positive impacts were set to zero, but in this
application they were explicitly used. Hence the name of this project. 
This generator uses the Tweety library from [Tweety-Project](http://tweetyproject.org/).

# Construction of c-representation
To generate the c-representations execute the main function in `PosCRep`. 
To add your own knowledgebase, please change `setKnowledgeBase` function accordingly.

# Search and experiments with impact-factors
If you want to change the impact-factors, please use the `ExperimentalSearch`, 
where you can find three possible methods.
