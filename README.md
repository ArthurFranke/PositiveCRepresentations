# PositiveCRepresentations

The given Java-Project lets you generate c-representations with both impact-factors. 
It was common to use c-representations, where all positive impacts were set to zero, but in this
application they were explicitly used. Hence the name of this project. 
This generator uses the Tweety library from http://tweetyproject.org/.

To generate the c-representations execute the main function in PositiveCRepresentations. 
To add your own knowledgebase, please change setKnowledgeBase function accordingly.

If you want to change the impact-factors, however you want to, please use the ExperimentalSearch, 
where you can find three possible methods, while the random one is preloaded in the main function.
